Hi and thanks for visiting my github;

There are some changes you should do with your code before.

First be sure you have installed Python on your device.

Then Edit code with any IDE or Code editor, even Notepad.

Read the lines wich have # and edit main code by those hints.

There is an additional part in line 19 that its not necessery.

This code is made for windows and if you set down the other versions
eg. (MacOS, Lynux,...)
Or even on diffrent browsers 
eg. (Safari, Opera, Firefox, Tor,...

create a fork and take a contribution on Github or send them to this email address as a .py file to be published here.
